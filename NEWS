EuroForMix v3.1.0 (Release date: 2020-09-08)
=============================================
Important updates:
- In GUI: It is now possible to export a frequency file from the 'Import data' panel (based on "Selected population").
- In GUI and contLikMLE function: The user can now change the steptol parameter used in the optimization. This makes it possible to increase accuracy of the results (steptol=0.001 is default from v3, whereas it was 1e-6 in earlier versions).
- MLE Optimizer strategy: Default number of optimizations set to 3 (instead of 2). This will make the MLE more robust. The user can change this at any time.
- Default drop-in probability is now "0.05" instead of "0".
- A new R-function called "qualLikMLE" has been included to the package, enabling more flexibility for inferring the qualitative model: Different drop-out probability for each contributor, in combination with fixed values, is possible. NB: This is not yet implemented in the GUI.
- Enabling degradation model for MPS-STR sequences with "RU:sequence" format, when kit is selected (only ForenSeq included): Example is "10:[ATCG]10", where "10" is extracted for fragment length lookup.
- Adding an error message if data is not properly structured before running contLikMLE: The function prepareC now throws the error "Please use the prepareData function to structure the data correctly." if last element.

Bug fixes:
- In function deconvolution: The startMarker indices was not correctly updated when no unknowns was given. This earlier caused crash.
- In function contLikMLE-L349: "maxPhi" replaced with "phi" (only syntax change).
- In function contLikSearch-L86: knownRel replaced with NULL. This bug caused the Optimal model search to fail when conditioning on known references under Hp/Hd and having relatedness under Hd. Thanks to Kent Harman for disovering this.

Added tests:
- test_logLik2contr1RepSNP -> Numerical testing with 1 and 2 unknowns for 1 replicate (ensures that data with SNP frequency data becomes correct).
- test_logLik2contr1RepNoStutter -> Numerical testing with 2 unknowns for 1 replicate (ensures that C++ function calcLogLikGammaMarkerUnknown is tested).
- test_QualLogLik2contr2Rep -> Numerical testing for drop-out probability inference with qualitative model, with different variants.
- test_logLikcontr2RepSNP renamed as test_logLik2contr2RepSNP.

Minor updates:
- Added error message in the prepareC function (L185-L189) if there are alleles in the frequency outcome which was not observed (except "99" allele): "In marker ....: There are alleles in the frequencies data are not found in the observed data. This is not allowed. Please use the prepareData function beforehand! Program stops.". Thanks to Guro Dorum for providing an example with this.
- The "Optimal quantitative LR (automatic model search)" module can only be run if hypothesis Hp and Hd only differ if a POI under Hp is replaced with an unknown under Hd.
- Better error print out when allele frequencies does not sum to one (prepareC:L65-L70 and calcGjoint:L31-L32).
- Added error message in function getData if any marker names between the data types are inconsistent.
- Small text changes in report and GUI regarding optimization settings.


EuroForMix v3.0.3 (Release date: 2020-05-06)
=============================================

Important bug fix in the fitgammamodel function (bug introduced in v3.0.0):
- The returned degradation parameter value was not correct (always overestimated). This influences the degradation slope plot in the EFM GUI. Also, the fix may cause faster convergence of MLE. 

Other fixed issue: 
- GUI crashed when loading settings after saving settings with old projects (created with a version before v3.0.0). Thanks to Peter Gill for pointing out this issue. 


EuroForMix v3.0.2 (Release date: 2020-05-06)
=============================================
Issue fix:
- The MCMC simulations failed if first random startpoint gave a likelihood of zero. Thanks to Eugenio Alladio and Maria Martin Agudo for reporting this issue.


EuroForMix v3.0.1 (Release date: 2020-04-24)
=============================================
Bug fix:
- Markers containing space caused problem when loading Marker settings after saving (reading from the configMarkerSetup file failed).


EuroForMix v3.0.0 (Release date: 2020-04-01)
=============================================
Summary of version 3 updates:
- Faster calculations due to paralellization on deeper level; causes speed to scale with the number of logical CPU cores (threads).
- Progress bar for all types of calculations. Time estimates given for the MLE method (if time exceeds 10s).
- Automatic model selection for the MLE method (number of contributors, Degradation (ON/OFF), BW-stutter (ON/OFF), FW-stutter (ON/OFF) decided based on the AkaikeInformationCriterion)
- Model extensions: Forward stutter model and Marker/Dye specific settings for analytical thresholds, dropin model and fst.
- Validation plots created (almost) instantly
- Seed settings: The MCMC and conservative LR values are now reproducible. Also optional seed can be given for the MLE method (reproducible start values, useful for time comparisons).
- Upper boundary of Likelihood Ratio provided in GUI (1/'Random match probability').

Details of the update:
 - GUI changes (efm):
	- In 'Generate data' panel: New layout. Includes Forward stutter. 
	- In 'Model specification' panel: Possibility of forward stutter model added.
	- In 'MLE fit' panel: New layout for better per-marker space. 
		- 'Only LR results' removed. 
		- adj.loglik added to loglik: adj.loglik = loglik - nparam
	- In create report this was added: 1) Frequency for rare alleles and 2) information of whether the frequencies were normalized after imputing rare alleles.
	
 - Bug fixes:
	- In function deconvolve: The genotype of known contributors were not taken into account when doing deconvolution with theta-correction (only known non-contributors).
	- In function plotTopMPS2: Inserting base pair of closest allele (for missing bp)

 - New implementation of the C++ engine (Armadillo/Rcpp not used any more):
	 - The C++ engine performs parallelization on genotype marginalisation over one for-loop which makes the speed scale with the number of CPU cores.

 - Model extensions:
	 - Forward stutter model.
	 - Marker dependent AT/pC/lambda/Fst parameters (also implemented for qualitative model).

 - New features:
 	- Monitoring progress (a progressbar is provided in console)
	- Automatic model selection (based on the AIC): Number of contributors, Degradation (ON/OFF), BW-stutter (ON/OFF), FW-stutter (ON/OFF)
 	- Seeds added to following functions: contLikMCMC,contLikMLE 
	- Optional 'normalization' handling of rare alleles (missing alleles in population frequency data): 
		- Can be changed under "Frequencies -> Set whether to normalize frequencies" (1=Yes, 0=No) 
		- Allele frequencies are by default normalized after including new alleles. In EFM v2 the default was not to normalize - set option equal 0=No for concordant results.

 - Following functions has been modified and updated because of the new C++ implementation:
	- prepareC
	- contLikMLE
	- contLikINT
	- contLikMCMC (depends on contLikMLE output)
	- validMLEmodel (depends on contLikMLE output)
	- deconvolve (depends on contLikMLE output)
	- logLiki (depends on contLikMLE output)

 - Following functions are not used anymore (but still there): contLikMCMCpara (calls contLikMCMC), contLikMLEpara (calls contLikMLE), iszerolik

 - Added functions: 
	- runexample: Illustration of using the most important methods in euroformix.
	- calcRMP: Calculates the random match probability of a specific profile.
	- conLikSearch: Searches through all model outcomes and shows the optimal model in the MLE panel. Table is visualised and also stored in report file.
	- sample_listToTable: Converts list structure to table (used by exporting)
	- sample_tableToList: Converts tables to list (used by importing)
	- prepareData: preparing data with Qassignation and filter data wrt analytical thresholds (possibly per marker)

 - Modified functions:
	- genDataset: Also includes forward stutter simulation and marker based analytical threshold
	- getKit: The user can specify other kit files than the one by default (more flexibility)
	- simDOdistr: The function now accepts dropin probability per marker (if provided)
 
 - Includes automated testing of the numerical calculations by C++ using 'testthat' (compares with manual R implementations)
	- See separete presentation "EFM3numtestPres" for a description
 
 - Other notes:
	- Degradation slope param can never exceed 1. This was possible before 
	- New optimization strategy for MLE (contLikMLE): 
		-> New strategy: Require nDone number of obtained local maximum values (set to 2 as default).
		-> Random start points are better chosen: Mixture proportions (flat, but sorted for unknowns), PHexp/PHvar/stuttprop/degradslope have lower variation.
		-> Faster convergence in nlm, but about same accuracy (minimum step tolerance (steptol) set to 1e-3 instead of 1e-6).
	- New sampling strategy for MCMC: No block-wise sampling provided and only one chain is run.
	- The parallel versions contLikMLEpara and contLikMCMCpara are no longer used (calls the original functions)
	- The likelihood of underflow numbers are now shown in MLE results.
	- CaseSolver v1.7 or newer should be used with this version.
