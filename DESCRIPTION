Description: Contains procedures for maximization, integration and MCMC of likelihoods of a quantitative model for DNA mixtures (STR/SNP) for a general specifications of hypotheses. It also contains procedures for estimating the profiles of unknown contributors (deconvolution). The implemented model takes care of drop-out, drop-in, degradation, stutters (both backward and forward). It also contains a graphical user interface (efm) to ease the use.
